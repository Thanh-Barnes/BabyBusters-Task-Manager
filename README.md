To do: 
- currently when add new task, it add new task in same box column. can we make it go left to right?
- when add new task, make sure the form clears form when adding another new task
- the modal closes if form is submitted and input is incorrect - to check?
- when creating `add task` - there are some default values?
- when page loads, there is a line in the grey container box before adding new task, issue?

When have time:
- update html id or class and make sure all reference is updated
- submit box in future to put in form
