Hi guys, if you have time you can check out my version and let me know what you think and if you want to incorporate some of the changes in our main project file

I have added the following:
- edit button (which updates current tasks and resets the status to TODO even when they are DONE)
- fixed new task modal to close when all validation is true
- updated nav bar with new name
- background to flow around the tasks

Thanh version to do
- to remove the button space in the edit and new task form (due to button being invisible)
- update music player
- footer icons to be black?
- sometimes the issue with the 'null' id happens - prob something to do with local storage or prob when make to many changes in the file. im going to test it out more often and see if it still happens
